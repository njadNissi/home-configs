# Deep 2D LiDAR Localization

## About the Project

This project focuses on localization using only 2D LiDAR scan point clouds, leveraging deep learning techniques to achieve precise position estimation. It aims to serve as a robust solution for robotics applications where minimal sensor inputs are available.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed. The project has been tested on Python 3.10.

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donymorph/deep_2Dlidar_localization.git
cd deep_2Dlidar_localization
```

### Create an Environment

You can use any of the following methods to create a virtual environment:

#### Option 1: Using Built-in Python Module (`venv`)

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

#### Option 2: Using `virtualenv`

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
myenv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

#### Option 3: Using `conda`

```bash
conda create --name myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```

### Install Dependencies

Once the environment is activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies
├── dataset/              # Folder for storing dataset CSV files
│   ├── odom_data_*.csv   # Odometry data
│   ├── scan_data_*.csv   # LaserScan data
└── models/               # Trained models saved here
```

## Usage

### 1. Data Collection

To collect LiDAR and odometry data, run the `data_collector.py` script using Python:

```bash
python3 data_collector.py 
         ///or
ros2 run deep_2Dlidar_localization data_collector_node
```

The script saves collected data as `odom_data_*.csv` and `scan_data_*.csv` in the `dataset/` directory. but make sure you have installed ROS2 humble version. it waits `/odom` and `/scan` data then starts recording.

### 2. Training the Model

To train the model, run:

```bash
python3 training.py
```

Key options for the script include:

- **`odom_csv`**: Path to the odometry CSV file
- **`scan_csv`**: Path to the LiDAR CSV file
- **`model_choice`**: Choose from `SimpleMLP`, `DeeperMLP`, `Conv1DNet`, `Conv1DLSTMNet`, `ConvTransformerNet`
- **`batch_size`**: Training batch size
- **`lr`**: Learning rate
- **`epochs`**: Number of training epochs

Example:

```bash
python3 training.py --odom_csv odom_data.csv --scan_csv scan_data.csv --model_choice ConvTransformerNet --batch_size 64 --lr 1e-4 --epochs 20
```

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization

To run hyperparameter optimization, execute:

```bash
python3 hyperparam_opt.py
```

You can explore Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization using the `hyperparam_opt.py` script.

## Results and Visualization

Training progress is logged using TensorBoard. To view training metrics:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir tensorboard_logs/
```

Access the TensorBoard UI in your browser at `http://localhost:6006`.
